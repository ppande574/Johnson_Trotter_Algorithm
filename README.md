# Johnson Trotter Algorithm
This program computes all permutations of a lexicographically sorted string using the [Johnson and Trotter algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/johnson-trotter-algorithm/). 

It is assumed that the string input is already sorted lexiographically. 

Inputs: String, "n" number of permutations that the user wishes to compute of the given string. 
Output: n number of permutations

ex. 

Input: "abcdef", 10

Output: 
    
    abcdef
    abcdfe
    abcfde
    abfcde
    afbcde
    fabcde
    fabced
    afbced
    abfced
    abcfed
