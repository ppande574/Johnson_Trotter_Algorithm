# Johnson_Trotter_Algorithm
This program computes all permutations of a lexiographically sorted string using the [Johnson and Trotter algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/johnson-trotter-algorithm/). 

It is assumed that the string is already sorted. 

Inputs: String, "n" number of permutations that the user wishes to compute of the given string.
